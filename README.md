# GodsEye
An MR based tool for vulnerability assessment.
What’s God’s Eye : MR based application that recognizes a person’s face and performs:

-> Overlay of user’s personal data.
-> Provide Vulnerability index (Amount of publicly available data of the person).

What we aim for : Make the tool as dystopian and creepy as possible.
